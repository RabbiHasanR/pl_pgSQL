# Graphs in Computer Science: A Guide for Engineers

Welcome to this comprehensive overview of graph theory fundamentals, tailored for software engineers, system designers, and algorithm enthusiasts. Graphs are a cornerstone of computer science, powering everything from social networks to routing algorithms. This guide uses simple text-based visuals (ASCII art) to illustrate concepts, making them easy to grasp and recall during interviews or implementation.

We'll cover the basics, properties, real-world applications, storage methods, key algorithms, and more. Each section follows a consistent pattern: **What it is**, a **Text-based visual**, and an **Explanation using the visual**.

## Graph Fundamentals

### What it is
Graphs model relationships between entities. They consist of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections).

Neighbors are directly connected vertices. A self-edge is a loop from a vertex to itself.

### Text-based visual
```
(0) --- (1) --- (2)
        |
       (3)

(4)
 |↺   (self-edge on 4)
```

### Explanation using the visual
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

Edges: (0–1), (1–2), (1–3), and a self-loop on 4.

Neighbors: For vertex 1, neighbors are [0, 2, 3]. Vertex 4 has itself as a neighbor due to the self-edge.

---

## Graph Categories and Properties

### Directed vs Undirected Graphs

#### What it is
Undirected: Edges have no direction; connectivity is mutual.

Directed: Edges have arrowed direction; connectivity may be one-way.

#### Text-based visual
```
Undirected: (A) — (B)

Directed:   (A) -> (B)
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Undirected: (A—B) means A can reach B and B can reach A via the same edge.

Directed: (A→B) means traversal permitted from A to B; not necessarily from B to A unless (B→A) exists.

### Weighted vs Unweighted Graphs

#### What it is
Weighted: Each edge carries a cost (distance, time, capacity).

Unweighted: All edges are treated equally (unit cost).

#### Text-based visual
```
Weighted:   (A) --5-- (B) --2-- (C)
Unweighted: (A) ---- (B) ---- (C)
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Weighted: Path costs add up; shortest path considers edge weights.

Unweighted: Shortest path equals fewest edges; BFS is effective.

### Disconnected Components

#### What it is
A disconnected graph has multiple components where not all vertices are mutually reachable.

A connected component is a maximal set of vertices reachable from each other.

#### Text-based visual
```
Component 1: (0) --- (1)

Component 2: (2) --- (3)
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Components: {0,1} and {2,3} are separate. No path connects 0/1 to 2/3.

---

## Real-World Applications

### Maps

#### What it is
Cities/intersections as vertices; roads as edges (often weighted by time or distance).

#### Text-based visual
```
CityA --- CityB --- CityC
   \               /
    \---- CityD ---/
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Routes: CityA can reach CityC via CityB or via CityD.

Routing: Shortest path algorithms find minimal travel time/cost routes.

### Social Networks

#### What it is
Users as vertices; relationships (friendships/follows) as edges.

#### Text-based visual
```
[Alice]---[Bob]---[Charlie]
   |                  |
 [Diana]-----------[Eve]
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Connectivity: Bob bridges Alice and Charlie; Diana and Eve form a strong tie across the network.

Analysis: Useful for communities, recommendations, influence graphs.

### Delivery Networks

#### What it is
Facilities/customers as vertices; delivery routes as edges with costs.

#### Text-based visual
```
Warehouse -- Hub1 -- Customer1
       \
        \-- Hub2 -- Customer2
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Routing: Warehouse reaches customers via hubs.

Optimization: Choose routes minimizing total cost/time or balancing capacity.

## Graph Storage Representations

### Adjacency List

#### What it is
Maps each vertex to a list of neighbors. Space-efficient for sparse graphs.

#### Text-based visual
```
Graph edges:
(0-1), (1-2), (1-3)

Adjacency list:
0: [1]
1: [0,2,3]
2: [1]
3: [1]
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Neighbors: Finding neighbors of 1 is O(x) where x = degree(1) = 3.

Space: O(V+E), ideal when E is much less than V².

### Adjacency Matrix

#### What it is
A V×V matrix where [u][v] indicates if an edge exists (and possibly weight).

#### Text-based visual
```
Vertices: 0,1,2,3

Matrix:
   0 1 2 3
0 [0 1 0 0]
1 [1 0 1 1]
2 [0 1 0 0]
3 [0 1 0 0]
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Edge checks: Constant-time existence check at [u][v].

Neighbors: Iteration across a row is O(V), better for dense graphs.

### Edge List

#### What it is
A simple list of edges; great for algorithms like Kruskal’s MST and DSU.

#### Text-based visual
```
Edge list:
[(0,1), (1,2), (1,3)]
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Sorting edges: For Kruskal’s, sort by weight and union-find to build MST.

Length: Number of edges equals list length.

### Implicit Graph (2D Grid)

#### What it is
Vertices are positions; edges are inferred by adjacency (up/down/left/right).

#### Text-based visual
```
[0,0] -- [0,1]
  |        |
[1,0] -- [1,1]
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Neighbors: [0,0] neighbors are [0,1] and [1,0].

Use cases: Pathfinding (BFS/DFS), maze solving, robotics movement.

## Traversals

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

#### What it is
Level-order exploration; finds shortest path in unweighted graphs.

#### Text-based visual
```
Graph:
(0) --- (1) --- (2)
        |
       (3)

BFS from 0 (levels):
Level 0: 0
Level 1: 1
Level 2: 2, 3
Visit order: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Queue-based: Processes neighbors layer by layer.

Shortest path: 0 to 3 via 1 has length 2 edges.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

#### What it is
Explores as deep as possible before backtracking; useful for components, cycles, and ordering.

#### Text-based visual
```
Graph:
(0) --- (1) --- (2)
        |
       (3)

One DFS path from 0:
0 -> 1 -> 3 -> backtrack -> 2
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Stack/recursion: Goes deep via 1 to 3, backtracks to 2.

Discovery/finish times: Power algorithms like SCC and Tarjan’s.

---

## Cycles

### Undirected Cycle Detection

#### What it is
Detects a closed walk using DFS with parent tracking or DSU (union-find).

#### Text-based visual
```
(0) --- (1)
 |       |
(3) --- (2)
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Cycle example: 0–1–2–3–0 is a cycle.

DFS rule: If you see a visited neighbor not equal to parent, a cycle exists.

### Directed Cycle Detection

#### What it is
Detects cycles using DFS recursion stack or Kahn’s algorithm (topo sort).

#### Text-based visual
```
A -> B -> C
^         |
|---------|
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Cycle: A→B→C→A.

Detection: A gray (in-stack) neighbor found during DFS indicates a cycle.

---

## Topological Sorting and DAGs

### What it is
A topological order lists vertices so every directed edge goes forward in the order.

Only possible for DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs).

### Text-based visual
```
A -> B -> C -> D
     \-> E
```

### Explanation using the visual
Valid orders: A, B, E, C, D or A, B, C, D, E (E must come after B).

Cycle-free: Any cycle would invalidate a topological ordering.

---

## Shortest Path Algorithms

### Dijkstra’s Algorithm

#### What it is
Greedy algorithm for shortest paths in graphs with non-negative weights.

#### Text-based visual
```
Weights:
(0) --1-- (1) --2-- (2)
  \                 /
   \------4--------/

Shortest 0 -> 2:
0 -> 1 -> 2 with cost 3
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Relaxation: Dist[1]=1, Dist[2] via 1 becomes 3, which beats direct 4.

Data structure: Priority queue (min-heap) gives O((V+E) log V).

### Bellman–Ford Algorithm

#### What it is
Dynamic programming algorithm handling negative weights and detecting negative cycles.

#### Text-based visual
```
(0) --1--> (1) --(-2)--> (2)
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Relax for V-1 rounds: Dist[1]=1, Dist[2]=-1 after relaxing (1→2).

Cycle detection: If any distance improves in the V-th relaxation, a negative cycle exists.

---

## Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

### What it is
A subset of edges connecting all vertices with minimum total weight, no cycles, in an undirected, connected graph.

### Text-based visual
```
Graph:
   (0)
  /   \
 1     2
 /       \
(1)---3---(2)

One MST:
(0-1, w=1)
(0-2, w=2)
Total = 3
```

### Explanation using the visual
Acyclic: Two edges connect all three vertices without forming a cycle.

Algorithms: Prim’s grows from a start node; Kruskal’s sorts edges and uses DSU.

---

## Strongly Connected Components (SCC)

### What it is
In a directed graph, an SCC is a maximal set of vertices where every vertex is reachable from every other.

### Text-based visual
```
SCC1:
A -> B -> C
^         |
|---------|

SCC2:
D -> E
```

### Explanation using the visual
SCC1: A, B, C form a cycle; mutual reachability holds.

Kosaraju steps: DFS to stack by finish times → transpose → DFS in stack order to extract SCCs.

---

## Bridges and Articulation Points

### Bridge

#### What it is
An edge whose removal increases the number of connected components.

#### Text-based visual
```
(0) --- (1) --- (2)
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Bridge: Removing (1–2) splits the graph: {0,1} and {2}.

Tarjan’s bridge test: Edge (u,v) is a bridge if low[v] > disc[u].

### Articulation Point

#### What it is
A vertex whose removal disconnects the graph.

#### Text-based visual
```
(0) --- (1) --- (2)
        |
       (3)
```

#### Explanation using the visual
Cut vertex: Removing 1 disconnects 3 (and may split 0 from 2 depending on edges).

Tarjan’s AP test: Non-root u is AP if a child v has low[v] ≥ disc[u]; root is AP if it has ≥2 DFS children.

---

## DFS Ancestors

### What it is
In a DFS tree, a vertex A discovered before B along the same path is an ancestor of B.

### Text-based visual
```
DFS order example:
0 -> 1 -> 3 -> backtrack -> 2
```

### Explanation using the visual
Ancestors: 0 is ancestor of 1, 3, 2; 1 is ancestor of 3 and 2.

Usage: Ancestor relations underpin low-link computations, cycle checks, and tree properties.
