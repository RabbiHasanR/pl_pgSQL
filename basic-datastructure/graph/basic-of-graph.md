graphs is network of nodes

node = vertex(vertices)

connection = edge

neighbours


applications of graphs:
1. maps
2. social network
3. delivery network

graphs algorithms:
shortest path
shortest cyclic path


vertex: every node of graph is a vertex
edge: edge is a connection between two vertex
uni-directional edge:
bi-directional/undirectional edge:

directed graph
undirected graph

edge based on weight
weighted graph
unweighted graph 


storing a graph:
adjacency list:list of lists like [[(0,2)], [(1,2),(1,3)],[(2,0),(2,1),(2,3)],[(3,1),(3,2)]]
adjacency matrix
edge list
2d matrix(implicit graph)
