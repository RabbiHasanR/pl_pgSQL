Whether you're prepping for system design interviews or building scalable applications, these concepts are *mandatory* to understand — and you’re bound to face them at some level in your career.

Let’s break it down in simple terms:
1. Client-Server Architecture – Like a restaurant: client orders, server serves. done
2. IP Address – Think of it as the digital home address for your device. done
3. DNS (Domain Name System) – Translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses. done
4. Proxy vs Reverse Proxy – One hides the client, the other protects the server. done
5. Latency – Time taken for a request to travel and return.  done
41. Throughput  done
42. Bandwidth done
6. HTTP/HTTPS – The language your browser speaks with the web. done
7. API – Bridge for apps to communicate.  done
8. REST API – The classic style for API calls (GET, POST, etc.). done
9. GraphQL – Ask for just the data you need. done 
10. Database – Your app’s long-term memory. -- DB done
12. Vertical Scaling – Powering up a server (like upgrading RAM). done
13. Horizontal Scaling – Adding more servers to share the load. done
14. Load Balancer – Distributes requests smartly. done
43. Consistent hashing done
19. Caching – Keeping frequently used data close (and fast). done
23. CDN (Content Delivery Network) – Serves content from a server near the user. done
26. Microservices – Breaking apps into manageable, independent services. done
38. Monolithic  done
39. Event driven - done
40. Domain Driven done
27. Message Queue – Processing tasks one at a time to avoid overload. done
46. PUB/SUB  done
47. Request/Repsonse done
29. API Gateway – A single entry point for your APIs (handles routing, auth, etc.). done
30. Idempotency – Repeating the same request gives the same result — crucial for payments. done
28. Rate Limiting – Prevents abuse by limiting how often users can hit your APIs. done
25. Webhooks – Auto-triggered actions on events (like sending a welcome email). done
45. SSE(server side event) -- done
46. short and long pooling -- done
44. RPC(Grpc) -- done
24. WebSockets – For real-time communication (e.g., chat apps). done
21. CAP Theorem – You can’t have consistency, availability & partition tolerance all at once. -- DB done
31. normalization vs denormalization -- DB done
35. 𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 -- DB done
36. 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐏𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 -- DB done
37.  𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐝 𝐕𝐢𝐞𝐰𝐬-- DB done
15. Indexing – Speeds up data retrieval in databases. -- DB done
16. Replication – Making backups for high availability. -- DB done
17. Sharding – Splitting large data across servers for performance. -- DB done
18. Vertical Partitioning – Separating columns to optimize queries. -- DB done
20. Denormalization – Storing redundant data for faster access. -- DB done
34. strong vs eventualy consistent -- DB done
33. batch and stream processing -- DB done
22. Blob Storage – For large files like images & videos. -- DB done
11. SQL vs NoSQL – Tables & schema vs flexible JSON-style storage. -- DB  done
